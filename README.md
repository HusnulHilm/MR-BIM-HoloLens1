# MR-BIM-HoloLens1
A project of combining MR technology, BIM, and HoloLens 1.

This project is based on a task of my master thesis that can be referred down below. Basically, this small project shows the potential of designing an interior with HoloLens 1. Compared to the other apps at the market out there, this project focus more on the learning process on how to develop a MR-BIM application with Unity. For this project, I am using:
1. Unity version 2019.4.33f
2. Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16.11.7


*Task of the master thesis* 

Using HoloLens as Mixed Reality Device for BIM as well as Interior Design 

1. Understanding the AR, VR concepts and HoloLens hardware specifications 
2. Get familiar with the Unity environment, create and deploy the application into HoloLens 
3. Understanding the BIM concepts as well as interior design 
4. Development of Unity application with MRTK 
5. Understanding the SLAM based on Spatial Mapping feature 
6. Create a final project for a vacant room, to 
 a) detect the surfaces 
 b) select a desired furniture from a pre-defined database 
 c) localize the furniture in desired place with capability to change its dimensions 
 *) in all above actions, the gravity must be considered as the general force on the object
